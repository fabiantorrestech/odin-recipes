  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Buffalo Wings are an american dish where chicken wings are traditionally cooked through then covered with a vinegary, hot sauce.<br>
    They are called buffalo wings because the dish originates from Buffalo, New York. The biggest variations with how the recipe is created are: <br>
    - Choice of sauce<br>
    - Method of cooking the chicken Wings<br>
    Some people prefer a more sweet or tangy sauce to the spicy sauce.<br>
    And while traditionally, the recipe calls for deep-frying, you can also air-fry or bake the chicken wings as well.<br>
    This recipe will go over how to make them with an oven.<br>
